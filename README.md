### Firmware for PAW3395 

[Download latest UF2](https://nightly.link/efogtech/endgame-trackball-config/workflows/build/paw3395/firmware.zip)

### Installation

You need to raise your bearings by 1 mm, otherwise the ball will scratch your lenses.  
Please install the included rubber feet to the bottom of your bearings of choice; in case you don't have those, anything with ø 12 mm and 1 mm thickness would do. 
For example, a piece of cardboard.
